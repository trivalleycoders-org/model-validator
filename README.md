# Model Validator

Just started - Not much to see here yet :(

This repository is a trial project to validate form data that will be inserted MongoDb.

Goals:
- check data type is of expected type
- check that required fields are present
- maybe: check shape for nested data (but we don't currently have any thankfully)
